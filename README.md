A simple, easy-to-use resource for victims of natural disasters to survive

## Inspiration
An oft-overlooked aspect of the aftermath of natural disasters is surviving until you're rescued. Unless you're a prepper, it is unlikely you've thought about it in depth, for good reason--the chances of a natural disaster do bad that you can't be rescued within a few hours happening to you is incredibly slim. 

That being said, it can happen, and at any given time there's probably several large and deadly disasters happening around the world. We want to help those who find themselves in that situation. 
## What it does
It is a bunch of custom tool to guide you in the event that you're stranded and trapped after a natural disaster. Thus, you can figure out how long you can "hunker down", what food you should eat first, where you should (and shouldn't) go if you need to travel, and how to navigate around obstacles if necessary. 
## How we built it
It is made using the Flutter framework and the Dart language.  Dart is nice because we can use it both for UI work, and for more backend-calculation type cases, with virtually no distinction in-between. We are also using APIs provided by Google Maps and NASA to chart out disasters and navigational info. 
## Challenges we ran into
Integrating interactive maps into our UI was easy, but making it look good was hard. The need to overlay widgets and cards, a persistent appbar on top, and so many other things were hard to arrange. Furthermore, at some point we just need to add more content that is tedious and slow, such as different cases for food storage. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we made a useful product for those in need of assistance, and we were able to work as a team to solve problems and figure the code out. 
## What we learned
We learned teamwork skills and API usage. We also increased our understanding of flutter.
